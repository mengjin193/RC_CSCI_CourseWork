				Randolph College: Software Development CSCI 346

			<div class="aboutmessage">
				<p class="p1">
					Team logSmart is a group of three students, Andrew Hayden, Mengjin Sun, and Emad Davis, who attend <a href="http://www.randolphcollege.edu/" target="blank">Randolph College</a> in Lynchburg, VA, and are in the first ever software development class at the college. For the majority of time and work spent in this class, we were to come up with a software development project we would work on throughout the semester (Spring 2019). After brainstorming through multiple thoughts and ideas, Andrew came up with the idea of a "research log", where students (researchers) and professors (research advisors) could keep track of their research progress in an organized manner. This idea provoked interest among the class and soon a team was put together to start implementing this conceptual idea into a digital reality. Once a plan was put in place, abstract completed, and software requirements specification typed, the coding began.

						We worked to make a user interface (UI) for research project management, logSmart. Since our UI is aimed at serving the needs of academia we consider two types of users: students and professors/research advisers &hellip; While Google classroom and Moodle try to create a paperless alternative to class rooms and framework for assignment distribution, LogSmart is directed specifically at student researchers and their faculty advisors. Moreover, our UI has a simpler and more intuitive design that creates a user friendly environment.

				</blockquote>
				<p class="p2">
					After the entire semester and many late nights, we have created just what we wanted to from our original abstract. We have created an extremely user friendly UI that is not only visibly appealing and easy to navigate, but it is completely unique in design since the front end was entirely made from scratch. This UI lets busy professors take a minute of their time to make sure their advisees are on the right track throughout the progress of their research. It also allows students to easily log their progress while quickly getting back to their overwhelming undergraduate or graduate schedules. Our ultimate mission is to assist faculty and students in making their lives a little more effortless in such a demanding and stressful period of time.
